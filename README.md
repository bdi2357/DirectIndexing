# DirectIndexing
Direct Indexing project repo
** Objective: Demonstrate direct indexing capabilities. Goals:
1. Develop an optimizer that can follow an index with known constituents, demonstrated on the S&P 500.
The objective is to minimize active risk.
Active risk means the standard deviation of the difference between portfolio return and the return of a benchmark
2. Follow an index with unknown constituents - Given a fund daily return (or other frequency) and domain/universe of securities that the fund is eligible to use find a trading strategy that mimics the fund returns.
For POC, S&P 500 will be used as an index and subset of securities in S&P 500 as universe
